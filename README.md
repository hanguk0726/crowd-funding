# Smart contract crowd funding

npm install && npm run dev

## 

This is my first attempt to interact with a smart contract.<br>
I implemented features such as connecting MetaMask, creating profiles and funding campaigns, as well as funding cancellation and claiming.<br>
The main task was to synchronize content CRUD and smart contract transactions on the frontend.<br>
